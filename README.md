Group Project!

(Duncan Anglin) I worked on the area known as the header. This included the navbar and the two sections underneath( The Focus on Your Business section and the 9 buttons to the side of it). Main thing used for these sections is bootstrap.


Sean : SignUP, SignIN pages. Some general styling on all the pages with fonts and colors.

Tapiwa: I created the css grid layouts, flex box and general containers for the 'how it works' and 'CRM landing' pages. Added the hover effects and linked the pages on the hyper links. Also added the start to explore Double tap, Email Dashboards, task management, Analytics, and project calendar contents in their appropriate containers.


Savanna: I created the footer section on both the how it works and the crm landing section. Used css properties to center the contents of the containers in the footer.
